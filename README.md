## Description

My motivation for this assignment was to practice working with multiple files and having them work together to make my application come together as a fluid wesbite
I built this project because I thought it would be great practice for working with basic front end and back end coding and good reference for practicing with local storage.
This website could be used personally as a personal page for posting thoughts or recipes or anything needed really.
I learned that going back to old work can be really uplifting when trying keep up your confidence learning coding as it puts a new perspective on how far you've come along as a programmer.
